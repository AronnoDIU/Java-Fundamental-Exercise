/**
 * What is Trie?
 * <p>
 * Trie is a type of k-ary search tree used for storing and searching a
 * specific key from a set. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought
 * to optimal limit (key length).
 * <p>
 * Advantages of tries
 * <p>
 * 1. In tries the keys are searched using common prefixes. Hence, it is faster.
 * The lookup of keys depends upon the height in case of a binary search tree.
 * <p>
 * 2. Tries to take less space when they contain a large number of short strings.
 * As nodes are shared between the keys.
 * <p>
 * 3. Tries help with the longest prefix matching, when we want to find the key.
