// Sorting a HashMap according to keys in Java
/**
 * We are given the details of marks scored by students in the form of a HashMap,
 * where the name of the student is the Key and the marks scored is the Value.
 * Our task is to sort the map according to the key values, i.e.,
 * the names of the students in the alphabetical(lexicographical) order.
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input :
 * Key = Jayanti, Value = 80
 * Key = Anushka, Value = 80
 * Key = Amit, Value = 75
 * Key = Abhilasha, Value = 90
 * Key = Danish, Value = 40
 * Output : Sorted Map according to Names:
 * Key = Abhilasha, Value = 90
 * Key = Amit, Value = 75
 * Key = Anushka, Value = 80
 * Key = Danish, Value = 40
 * Key = Jayanti, Value = 80
