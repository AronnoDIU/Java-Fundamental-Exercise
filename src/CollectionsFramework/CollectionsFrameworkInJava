#Collections in Java
    The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of
objects. Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching,
sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion. Java Collection means a single unit of objects.
Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes
(ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

#What is Collection in Java?
    A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

#What is a framework in Java?
     It provides ready-made architecture.
     It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
     It is optional.

#What is Collection framework?
    The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing
and manipulating a group of objects. It has:
     1. Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
     2. Algorithms

The Map Interface: A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys:
Each key can map to at most one value. It models the mathematical function abstraction. The Map interface
includes methods for basic operations(such as put, get, remove, containsKey, containsValue, size, and empty),
bulk operations (such as putAll and clear), and collection views (such as keySet, entrySet, and values).

The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations:
    1. HashMap
    2. TreeMap
    3. LinkedHashMap
Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

Collection Views: The Collection view methods allow a Map to be viewed as a Collection in these three ways:
    keySet — the Set of keys contained in the Map.
    values — The Collection of values contained in the Map. This Collection is not a Set,
because multiple keys can map to the same value.
    entrySet — the Set of key-value pairs contained in the Map. The Map interface provides
a small nested interface called Map.Entry, the type of the elements in this Set.

The SortedMap Interface: A SortedMap is a Map that maintains its entries in ascending order, sorted
according to the keys' natural ordering, or according to a Comparator provided at the time of the
SortedMap creation. Natural ordering and Comparators are discussed in the Object Ordering section.
The SortedMap interface provides operations for normal Map operations and for the following:

    Range view — performs arbitrary range operations on the sorted map
    Endpoints — returns the first or the last key in the sorted map
    Comparator access — returns the Comparator, if any, used to sort the map




A. List Interface: A List is an ordered Collection (sometimes called a sequence). Lists may contain
duplicate elements. In addition to the operations inherited from Collection,
the List interface includes operations for the following:

    Positional access — manipulates elements based on their numerical position in the list.
This includes methods such as get, set, add, addAll, and remove.

    Search — searches for a specified object in the list and returns its numerical position.
Search methods include indexOf and lastIndexOf.

    Iteration — extends Iterator semantics to take advantage of the list's sequential nature.
The listIterator methods provide this behavior.

    Range-view — The sublist method performs arbitrary range operations on the list.

List Algorithms: Most polymorphic algorithms in the Collections class apply specifically to List.
Having all these algorithms at your disposal makes it very easy to manipulate lists. Here's a
summary of these algorithms, which are described in more detail in the Algorithms section.

    sort — sorts a List using a merge sort algorithm, which provides a fast, stable sort.
(A stable sort is one that does not reorder equal elements.)
    shuffle — randomly permutes the elements in a List.
    reverse — reverses the order of the elements in a List.
    rotate — rotates all the elements in a List by a specified distance.
    swap — swaps the elements at specified positions in a List.
    replaceAll — replaces all occurrences of one specified value with another.
    fill — overwrites every element in a List with the specified value.
    copy — copies the source List into the destination List.
    binarySearch — searches for an element in an ordered List using the binary search algorithm.
    indexOfSubList — returns the index of the first sublist of one List that is equal to another.
    lastIndexOfSubList — returns the index of the last sublist of one List that is equal to another.


    1. ArrayList class is most likely Arrays, but variable size DataStructure.
which is usually the better-performing implementation

    2. LinkedList class collects or adds different type of object.
which offers better performance under certain circumstances.

    3. Vector class is most likely the ArrayList class, but it's offers Thread Safety
        3a. Stack class are commonly used with FIFO or LIFO methods

B. Queue Interface: used with FIFO methods
A Queue is a collection for holding elements prior to processing.Besides basic Collection operations,
queues provide additional insertion, removal, and inspection operations.

Queues typically, but not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements according to their values(Object Ordering).
Whatever ordering is used, the head of the queue is the element that would be removed by a call to remove
or poll. In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue. Other kinds of queues
may use different placement rules. Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.

Queue Interface Structure:
Type of Operation 	Throws exception 	Returns special value
Insert              	add(e) 	            offer(e)
Remove 	                remove()        	poll()
Examine             	element()       	peek()

Object Ordering:

Classes         Implementing Comparable
Class 	        Natural Ordering
Byte 	        Signed numerical
Character 	    Unsigned numerical
Long 	        Signed numerical
Integer 	    Signed numerical
Short   	    Signed numerical
Double  	    Signed numerical
Float 	        Signed numerical
BigInteger 	    Signed numerical
BigDecimal 	    Signed numerical
Boolean 	    Boolean.FALSE < Boolean.TRUE
File 	        System-dependent lexicographic on path name
String  	    Lexicographic
Date 	        Chronological
CollationKey 	Locale-specific lexicographic


    1. PriorityQueue class
    2. LinkedList class
    3. Deque Interface->Usually pronounced as deck, a deque is a double-ended-queue. A double-ended-queue
is a linear collection of elements that supports the insertion and removal of elements at both end points.
The Deque interface is a richer abstract data type than both Stack and Queue because it implements both
stacks and queues at the same time. The Deque interface, defines methods to access the elements at
both ends of the Deque instance. Methods are provided to insert, remove, and examine the elements.
Predefined classes like ArrayDeque and LinkedList implement the Deque interface.

Note that the Deque interface can be used both as last-in-first-out stacks and first-in-first-out queues.
The methods given in the Deque interface are divided into three parts:
        3a. ArrayDeque class

Insert: The addfirst and offerFirst methods insert elements at the beginning of the Deque instance.
The methods addLast and offerLast insert elements at the end of the Deque instance. When the capacity
of the Deque instance is restricted, the preferred methods are offerFirst and offerLast because
addFirst might fail to throw an exception if it is full.

Remove: The removeFirst and pollFirst methods remove elements from the beginning of the Deque instance.
The removeLast and pollLast methods remove elements from the end. The methods pollFirst and pollLast
return null if the Deque is empty whereas the methods removeFirst and removeLast throw an exception
if the Deque instance is empty.

Retrieve: The methods getFirst and peekFirst retrieve the first element of the Deque instance.
These methods dont remove the value from the Deque instance. Similarly, the methods getLast
and peekLast retrieve the last element. The methods getFirst and getLast throw an exception
if the deque instance is empty whereas the methods peekFirst and peekLast return NULL.

The 12 methods for insertion, removal and retrieval of Deque elements are summarized in the following table:

Deque Methods
Type of Operation:First Element (Beginning of the Deque instance):Last Element (End of the Deque instance)
Insert 	            addFirst(e)      offerFirst(e)                     	addLast(e)       offerLast(e)

Remove 	            removeFirst()    pollFirst()                       	removeLast()     pollLast()

Examine             getFirst()       peekFirst()                       	getLast()        peekLast()


C. Set Interface: A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical
set abstraction. The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection and adds the restriction
that duplicate elements are prohibited. Set also adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals
and hashCode operations, allowing Set instances to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation
types differ. Two Set instances are equal if they contain the same elements.

The Java platform contains three general-purpose Set implementations:
    1. HashSet: which stores its elements in a hash table, is the best-performing implementation; however
it makes no guarantees concerning the order of iteration. TreeSet,

    2. LinkedHashSet: which is implemented as a hash table with a linked list running through it,
orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
LinkedHashSet spares its clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic ordering provided by
HashSet at a cost that is only slightly higher.

    3. TreeSet: which stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders its elements based on
their values; it is substantially slower than HashSet.

Set Interface Bulk Operations: Bulk operations are particularly well suited to Sets; when applied, they
perform standard set-algebraic operations. Suppose s1 and s2 are sets. Here's what bulk operations do:

    s1.containsAll(s2) — returns true if s2 is a subset of s1. (s2 is a subset of s1 if set s1
contains all of the elements in s2.)

    s1.addAll(s2) — transforms s1 into the union of s1 and s2. (The union of two sets is the
set containing all of the elements contained in either set.)

    s1.retainAll(s2) — transforms s1 into the intersection of s1 and s2. (The intersection of
two sets is the set containing only the elements common to both sets.)

    s1.removeAll(s2) — transforms s1 into the (asymmetric) set difference of s1 and s2.
(For example, the set difference of s1 minus s2 is the set containing all of the elements
found in s1 but not in s2.)

C1. The SortedSet Interface: A SortedSet is a Set that maintains its elements in ascending order,
sorted according to the elements' natural ordering or according to a Comparator provided at SortedSet
creation time. In addition to the normal Set operations,
the SortedSet interface provides operations for the following:

    Range view — allows arbitrary range operations on the sorted set
    Endpoints — returns the first or last element in the sorted set
    Comparator access — returns the Comparator, if any, used to sort the set

Set Operations: The operations that SortedSet inherits from Set behave identically
on sorted sets and normal sets with two exceptions:

    The Iterator returned by the iterator operation traverses the sorted set in order.
    The array returned by toArray contains the sorted set's elements in order.

Although the interface doesn't guarantee it, the toString method of the Java platform's SortedSet
implementations returns a string containing all the elements of the sorted set, in order.
