 * Approach 2: (Using DFS)
 * <p>
 * We can use Depth–first search (DFS) to solve this problem. The idea is to start
 * from the source node in the matrix, replace its color with the replacement color
 * and recursively explore all its valid eight adjacent pixels, and replace their
 * color. Note that we don’t need a visited array here as we are replacing the color
 * of every processed node, and it won’t be considered again next time as it will
 * have a different color.
