 * We can solve this problem by using the properties of a complete binary tree.
 * We know that in the array representation of a binary tree,
 * the left child for a node at index i is present at index 2i+1, and the right
 * child is present at index 2i+2. If we construct an array with all the tree
 * elements at the corresponding positions, then the elements will hold
 * consecutive positions for a complete binary tree. If any vacant position
 * is found, then the tree cannot be complete.
