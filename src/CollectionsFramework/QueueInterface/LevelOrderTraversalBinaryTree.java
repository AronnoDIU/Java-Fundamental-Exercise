/**
 * We have already discussed preorder, inorder and postorder traversals of the binary tree,
 * which are nothing but variations of Depth–first search of a Tree.
 * Trees can also be traversed in level order, where we visit every node
 * on a level before going to a lower level.
 * This search is referred to as level order traversal or Breadth - first search (BFS),
 * as the search tree is broadened as much as possible on each depth before going
 * to the next depth.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A simple solution is to print all nodes of level 1 first, followed by level 2,
 * until level h, where h is the tree’s height.
 * We can print all nodes present in a level by modifying the preorder traversal
 * on the tree.
