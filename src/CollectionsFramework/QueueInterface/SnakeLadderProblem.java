/**
 * The idea is to consider the snake and ladders board as a directed graph and run
 * Breadthâ€“first search (BFS) from the starting node, vertex 0, as per game rules.
 * We construct a directed graph, keeping in mind the following conditions:
 * <p>
 * 1. For any vertex in graph v, we have an edge from v to v+1, v+2, v+3, v+4, v+5,
 * v+6 as we can reach any of these nodes in one throw of dice from node v.
 * 2. If any of these neighbors of v has a ladder or snake,
 * which takes us to position x, then x becomes the neighbor instead of the
 * base of the ladder or head of the snake.
 * <p>
 * Now the problem is reduced to finding the shortest path between two nodes
 * in a directed graph problem.
 * We represent the snake and ladders board using a map.
