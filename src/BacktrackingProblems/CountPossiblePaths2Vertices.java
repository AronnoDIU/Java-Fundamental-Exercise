/*Count the total number of ways or paths that exist between two vertices in a
directed graph. These paths donâ€™t contain a cycle, the simple enough reason is
that a cycle contains an infinite number of paths and hence they create a problem*/

/*    For the following Graph:

              >     B
             /       |    \
            /        |      \

           \        /|
            \   /    |_________>
            > C <---------------D


    Input: Count paths between A and E
    Output: Total paths between A and E are 4
    Explanation: The 4 paths between A and E are:

                          A -> E
                          A -> B -> E
                          A -> C -> E
                          A -> B -> D -> C -> E

    Input: Count paths between A and C
    Output: Total paths between A and C are 2
    Explanation: The 2 paths between A and C are:

                          A -> C
                          A -> B -> D -> C*/
